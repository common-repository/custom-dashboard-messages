Allow admin to write messages on user dashboard.

== Description ==

You can write a main message, visible to everybody in dashboard widget. You can also write a bunch of messages in different dashboard widget, visible for all users with rights.
Admin can read and write all the messages and setup user roles, who can read and write custom messages.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `custom-dashboard-messages` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

`Can i write more main messages?`

In default no, because it´s saved in web options, so that´s why there is just one message.
